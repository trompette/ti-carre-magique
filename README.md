# Carr√© Magique

This is the version 2 of a small game project I wrote a long time ago for my TI-89 calculator.

The first version can be found on [ticalc.org](http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/232/23253.html).

## Building the game

You can compile the `carremag.89z` binary file with:

    make carremag

## Running the game

Run the binary file on a real TI-89 calculator or use [TiEmu](http://lpg.ticalc.org/prj_tiemu/).

## Licensing information

Have a look at the LICENSE file.
